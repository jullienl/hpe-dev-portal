HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric is a new offering from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It is positioned as a multi-modal hybrid data plane for the enterprise.

For the global enterprise, multi-cloud hybrid is a reality, with 80% of enterprises running their IT operations across multiple public clouds and on-premises data centers or co-locations. 

For many decades, enterprises have struggled with issues caused by having islands of data, firstly across internal IT systems, and now exacerbated by cloud separation. They have been faced with challenges of providing insight into available assets, a single view, a single version of truth, management across silos, governance, and security – all multiplied in effort and complexity with public clouds. 

HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric targets the following enterprise challenges with big data:

1. Moving data is hard    

2. Applications need to re-factored when switching between on and off premise   

3. Relocating data on prem ensures vendor lock in attracts huge move out costs   

4. Its hard to stage data near a cloud to enable bursting as needed   


To address these challenges, HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric enables features like Global Namespace, a consistent application layer to develop against, multi-modal interfaces (NFS, S3, Kafka and HDFS) and data transport solutions. It also enables a fine-grained consumption model and associated pricing.

HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric strives to enable this abstraction for quantifiable business outcomes. It lets customers focus on their business instead of spending time and effort constantly trying to find and relocate data.
