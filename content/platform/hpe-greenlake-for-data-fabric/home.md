GreenLake for Data Fabric (GL4DF) is a brand-new offering from HPE GreenLake. It is positioned as a multi modal hybrid data plane for the enterprise. 

For the global enterprise, multi-cloud hybrid is a reality, with 80% of enterprises running their IT operations across multiple public clouds and on-premises data centers or co-locations. 

Enterprises have, for many decades, struggled with islands of data, firstly across internal IT systems, and now these challenges are exacerbated with cloud separation. Challenges of providing insight to available assets, a single view, a single version of the truth, management across silos, governance, security all multiply in effort and complexity with public clouds. 

HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric targets the following enterprise challenges with big data

1. Moving data is hard 
2. Applications need to re-factored when switching between on and off premise
3. Relocating data on prem ensures vendor lock in attracts huge move out costs
4. Its hard to stage data near a cloud to enable bursting as needed

To solve for these challenges HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric enables features like Global Namespace, consistent application layer to develop against, multi modal interfaces (NFS, S3, Kafka and HDFS) and data transport solutions and enables fine grained consumption model and associated pricing.

HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric strives to enable this abstraction for quantifiable business outcomes. It lets the customer focus in the on-business logic instead of the effort of finding and relocating data.
